# Personal-Data-Set-Project

This is a project for DATA 115, Introduction to Data Analytics, at Washington State University. We were tasked with picking data that we find interesting and perform all the necessary steps in doing data analysis. 

The data that we chose to use was from the MLB regular seasons of 2009-2021, excluding 2020.

The data collecting, cleaning, and transforming were all fairly simple. We downloaded the CSV from https://www.fangraphs.com/. From the homepage of fangraphs we clicked on Team Stats. From there we went down to the Multiple Seasons and entered 2007 to 2020. Then we went down to the Custom Leaderboards and created our own Leaderboard by selecting the columns Season, Team, Win, Loss, ERA, Base_on_Balls, HBP, WP, Balls, Strikes, K/9, BB/9, K/BB, and Velo. After looking at the data we realized that the 2020 season where there were only 60 games played would be an outlier. We chose to exclude this data from our analysis. In doing this we chose to only use odd numbered years in the data starting with 2009 and ending with 2021.
